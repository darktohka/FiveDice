This game was created by the FiveDice Developer Team.\n
A team of four members:\n
-   Turony Evelin\n
-   Babos Dávid\n
-   Deé Lukács András Gergely\n
-   Derzsi Dániel\n\n
This project was created as part of an Erasmus programme, this is our final dissertation.\n\n
Project information:\n\n
This project is a simple, yet distractive game called FiveDive. Each player has 5 dice, with which they must reach a given score threshold.\n\n
Gameplay:\n
In our game there are two game modes you can choose from:\n
-   Player versus Player – where two players can play against each other,\n
-   Player versus AI – where a player can play against the computer.\n\n
In every turn, each player has 3 rounds to throw their dice.\n\n
After the first throw, the players can decide which dice they want to throw again, by keeping them or discarding them.\n\n
After the 3 throws, the points will be added from the dice and that will be the player\'s final score.\n\n
When one of the players reach the given score threshold, the game will end and the player with the biggest score will be the winner.\n\n
The gameplay is made more exciting by the addition of sound effects and animations.</string>
